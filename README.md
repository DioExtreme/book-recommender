# book-recommender
A book recommender system made with Pandas and NLTK as homework for a university course.

It uses the Book-Crossing dataset which you can find [here.](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~cziegler/BX/) Make sure to download the .csv files.

Because of the questions related to the homework assignment, it is only recommended that you run the .py file in an empty folder as it generates many files.

## Requirements
The pandas and nltk modules are required.
```
pip install pandas
pip install nltk
```

The .csv files have to be in the same location as the .py file.

## Usage

```
python recommender.py
```
